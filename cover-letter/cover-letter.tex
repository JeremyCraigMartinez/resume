\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a senior software engineer with over 5 years of experience currently working at Avalara. I am in my last year of graduate school (part time) striving towards a MS in computer science with a focus on interactive intelligence and machine learning. I am from the Pacific Northwest, having lived the majority of my life in Washington state. Before moving to Seattle, I was living/working in Hamburg, Germany where I started my career in software at a small tech start up, Figo GmbH. I love to travel and backpack, and hope to one day backpack across South America, Africa and Asia.

\lettersection{Why ML6?}
I have long since considered myself a hacker, having to figure out most of the toolset I know now on the job or mid-project. ML6 clearly wants someone who can move at a fast pace, pick up what with the teams current momentum, with a strong technical background that allows them to do so. Git version control is listed in the preferred qualifications. While this is an individual bullet point, I think it speaks volumes to what ML6 is looking for. For example, I would love to discuss the trade-offs merging and rebasing have in the health of your git commit history. I have educational experience (and a small amount of work experience) using ML algorithms and fitting models. I have the discipline and drive to build on this experience, and I believe ML6 is the place to do this.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I do not have a deep background in ML, however, I have never had a deep background in any position I've been hired for. When I started at Figo GmbH, I was fresh out of school having zero full time experience. I quickly learned their stack and built out their API testing and CI. When I started at Avalara, I had to learn on the job how to write frontend tests, build out production systems in AWS, dockerize our applications, script and automate a full CI/CD in Jenkins, and more. I am wrapping up my degree with ML/AI at Georgia Tech, and I am confident I can ramp up to speed in whatever is necessary to excel in a ML oriented role.

I have the discipline to learn and perspective to see the full spectrum, that stands out among my peers. I work at a high velocity and am confident that no matter what the task is, I will thrive in accomplishing that task. ML6 needs an engineer that can touch all aspects of the stack, but have an passion and deep understanding on how to train ML models. I believe I fit this description and would make a valuable asset.
