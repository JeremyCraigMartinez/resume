\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a senior software engineer with over 5 years of experience currently working at Avalara. I am in my last year of graduate school (part time) striving towards a MS in computer science with a focus on interactive intelligence and machine learning. I am from the Pacific Northwest, having lived the majority of my life in Washington state. Before moving to Seattle, I was living/working in Hamburg, Germany where I started my career in software at a small tech start up, Figo GmbH. I love to travel and backpack, and hope to one day backpack across South America, Africa and Asia.

\lettersection{Why AirGrid?}
AirGrid advertised \hyperlink{https://edgekit.org/}{EdgeKit} in the Hacker News Who's Hiring post. I have a strong background in Node.js and I am pursuing my MS in CS with a specialization in ML & AI. I can contribute to both of these aspects of the business, and see the full spectrum of products AirGrid is working on. I have experience contributing to smaller teams in tech start ups from my days at Figo GmbH. The fact that this position is contract to hire gives me the opportunity to prove my ability to ramp up in my ML abilities, while also contributing to npm modules the team is maintaining.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I do not have a deep background in ML, however, I have never had a deep background in any position I've been hired for. When I started at Figo GmbH, I was fresh out of school having zero full time experience. I quickly learned their stack and built out their API testing and CI. When I started at Avalara, I had to learn on the job how to write frontend tests, build out production systems in AWS, dockerize our applications, script and automate a full CI/CD in Jenkins, and more. I am wrapping up my degree with ML/AI at Georgia Tech, and I am confident I can ramp up to speed in whatever is necessary to excel in a ML oriented role.

I have the discipline to learn and perspective to see the full spectrum, that stands out among my peers. I work at a high velocity and am confident that no matter what the task is, I will thrive in accomplishing that task. AirGrid needs an engineer that can touch all aspects of the stack, but have an passion and deep understanding on how to train ML models. I believe I fit this description and would make a valuable asset.
