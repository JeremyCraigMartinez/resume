# Hello, Google! Welcome to my resume repository!

This is a collection of resources like a resume, cover letter, coding projects, etc. and is intended to serve as my professional profile. Below you will find links to these resources.

### Professional documents

- [Resume](./RESUME.md)
- [Cover letter](COVER_LETTER.md)

### Coding projects

If you have trouble accessing any of the following projects, please email me directly and I will add you as a collaborator. Due to the nature of some of the content (Georgia Tech projects mostly) I am unable to publicize a handful of the projects below
- [OpenAI's Lunar Lander write up](https://github.com/JeremyCraigMartinez/RL-CS7642/blob/master/p2/main.pdf) - source code for this project can also be found in [this same directory](https://github.com/JeremyCraigMartinez/RL-CS7642/tree/master/p2).
